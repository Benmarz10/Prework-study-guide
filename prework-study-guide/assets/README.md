# Prework-study-guide Webpage
a study guide for the course work
This is a study guide webpage that I created from scratch. I made this to help myself learn how to code. This website is better than a pen and paper study guide because it provides me with coding experience. I learned how to do use all of the necessary coding tools and begin to apply them.
